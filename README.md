# “ DUAL ! THE TWO PLAYER GAMES ”

This is a project of two interactive games in one application. “Tic-Tac-Toe" is one of these games and the other one is “Puzzle-15 “. Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the paper-and-pencil games. This game requires two players in a 3x3 grid with Player 1 acts as “O” and Player 2 acts as “X”, or vice versa. The objective of this game is to take place of three connecting grids in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way/fork.  Also, the 15-puzzle is a well-known game which has a long history stretching back in the 1870's. The goal of the game is to arrange a shuffled set of 15 numbered tiles in ascending order, by sliding tiles into the one vacant space on a 4x4 grid. This research findings explain the common AI algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe and Puzzle-15 game, including the strategy in order to beat human player.
